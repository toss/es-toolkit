This function is fully implemented and ready to use, but documentation is still being written.

::: info
This function is only available in `es-toolkit/compat` for compatibility reasons. It either has alternative native JavaScript APIs or isn't fully optimized yet.

When imported from `es-toolkit/compat`, it behaves exactly like lodash and provides the same functionalities, as detailed [here](../../../compatibility.md).

# withTimeout

Executes an async function and enforces a timeout.

If the promise does not resolve within the specified time,
the timeout will trigger and the returned promise will be rejected.

## Signature

```typescript
function withTimeout<T>(run: () => Promise<T>, ms: number): Promise<T>;
```

### Parameters

- `run` (`() => Promise<T>`): A function that returns a promise to be executed.
- `ms` (`number`): The timeout duration in milliseconds.

### Returns

(`Promise<T>`): A promise that resolves with the result of the `run` function or rejects if the timeout is reached.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
try {
  await withTimeout(() => new Promise(() => {}), 1000); // Timeout exception after 1 second
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Will log 'The operation was timed out'
}
```

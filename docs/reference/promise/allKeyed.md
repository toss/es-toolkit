# allKeyed

Resolves an object of promises concurrently, returning an object with the same keys and resolved values.

Similar to `Promise.all`, but accepts an object of promises instead of an array, preserving the keys in the result. This makes it easy to destructure the resolved values by name instead of relying on positional indices.

Based on the [TC39 `Promise.allKeyed` proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-await-dictionary).

## Signature

```typescript
function allKeyed<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(
  tasks: T
): Promise<{ [K in keyof T]: Awaited<T[K]> }>;
```

### Parameters

- `tasks` (`T`): An object whose values are promises (or plain values) to resolve concurrently.

### Returns

(`Promise<{ [K in keyof T]: Awaited<T[K]> }>`): A promise that resolves to an object with the same keys and resolved values.

## Examples

```typescript
import { allKeyed } from 'es-toolkit/promise';

const { user, posts } = await allKeyed({
  user: fetchUser(),
  posts: fetchPosts(),
});

// Plain values are also supported
const result = await allKeyed({
  a: Promise.resolve(1),
  b: 2,
});
// { a: 1, b: 2 }
```

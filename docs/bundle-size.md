Bundle Footprint
============

![Graph showing the difference in bundle size between es-toolkit and lodash. There is a difference up to 97% in bundle size.](/assets/bundle-size.png)

With its modern implementation, es-toolkit significantly reduces its bundle size, cutting it down by up to 97% compared to other libraries like lodash. 

This makes es-toolkit the most efficient in terms of bundle size, with some utility functions being as small as less than 100 bytes.

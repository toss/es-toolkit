About es-toolkit
===============

es-toolkit is a cutting-edge JavaScript utility library that offers a collection of powerful functions for everyday use. Compared to alternatives like lodash, es-toolkit provides a significantly smaller bundle size (up to 95% less) and 2-3 times faster runtime performance. This is achieved through a modern implementation that leverages the latest JavaScript features.

es-toolkit comes with built-in TypeScript types and has been rigorously tested, ensuring 100% test coverage for maximum reliability.

Here are some of the features es-toolkit offers:

- **Array**: Utilities for array manipulation, such as [uniq](./reference/array/uniq.md) and [difference](./reference/array/difference.md)
- **Function**: Tools for controlling function execution, including [debounce](./reference/function/debounce.md) and [throttle](./reference/function/throttle.md)
- **Math**: Numerical utilities like [sum](./reference/math/sum.md) and [round](./reference/math/round.md)
- **Object**: Tools for manipulating JavaScript objects, such as [pick](./reference/object/pick.md) and [omit](./reference/object/omit.md)
- **Predicate**: Type guard functions like [isNotNil](./reference/predicate/isNotNil.md)
- **Promise**: Asynchronous utilities like [delay](./reference/promise/delay.md)

# Problem-Solving Documentation

- Define clear problem situations
  - Distinguish between causes and symptoms
  - Include error messages and log examples for better understanding
- Provide immediately applicable solutions
  - Solutions should be clear and ready to implement
  - Include code examples, commands, and configuration methods
  - Explain the principles behind the solution
- Consider environmental differences
  - Address how the same problem might appear in different environments or settings

## Template

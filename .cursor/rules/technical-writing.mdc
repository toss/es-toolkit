# Technical Writing Guidelines

## Understanding Documentation Types

- Classifying and selecting documentation based on goals helps design more effective information and experiences for readers.
- Decision tree for classification:
  - New technology, want to understand basics = Learning-focused documentation [learning-focused-docs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/learning-focused-docs.mdc)
  - Need to solve specific problems = Problem-solving documentation [problem-solving-docs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/problem-solving-docs.mdc)
  - Need to know specific feature/API usage = Reference documentation [reference-docs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/reference-docs.mdc)
  - Want deep understanding of concepts = Explanatory documentation [explanatory-docs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/explanatory-docs.mdc)
- Documentation types can be combined for more effective results.
- Follow the template for each document type.

## Information Architecture

- Focus on one goal per page
  - If heading levels exceed 4 levels, consider splitting into multiple documents
  - For introducing multiple concepts briefly, create an overview page with links to individual documents
- Provide value first
  - Place additional information and details later
  - Clearly communicate what readers can gain or what problems they can solve
  - Avoid feature-focused explanations; prioritize value to readers
  - Example: "This API enables real-time log data processing" instead of "This API offers various configuration options"
- Write effective titles
  - Titles should concisely convey the core content
  - Create clear, searchable titles with key keywords
  - Maintain consistency
  - Use declarative sentences instead of exclamations or questions
- Include an overview
  - Summarize the key content of the document
  - Clearly communicate the document's purpose to readers
  - Provide essential information before technical background
- Make content predictable
  - Maintain consistent titles, formats, and structures
  - Follow the same pattern for section headings
  - Arrange information in logical order
  - Use terminology consistently

## Writing Effective Content

- Clarify the subject
  - Don't use tools, technologies, or systems as subjects of actions
  - Focus on what developers can do after reading the document
  - Use active voice
- Include only necessary information
  - Keep sentences short and concise
  - Minimize metadiscourse
- Write specifically
  - Use verbs instead of nouns
  - Prefer clear expressions over ambiguous ones
- Write consistently
  - Follow official technical terminology
  - Don't express the same concept in multiple ways
  - Spell out abbreviations before first use

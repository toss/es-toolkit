## Reporting a Vulnerability

We consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

Please refrain from reporting security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

If you discover a security vulnerability, report the security issue to the project maintainers directly at [opensource@toss.im](mailto:opensource@toss.im).

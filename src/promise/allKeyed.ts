/**
 * Resolves an object of promises concurrently, returning an object with the same keys and resolved values.
 *
 * Similar to `Promise.all`, but accepts an object of promises instead of an array,
 * preserving the keys in the result. This makes it easy to destructure the resolved values
 * by name instead of relying on positional indices.
 *
 * Based on the [TC39 `Promise.allKeyed` proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-await-dictionary).
 *
 * @template T - A record type where each value is a promise or a value.
 * @param {T} tasks - An object whose values are promises (or plain values) to resolve concurrently.
 * @returns {Promise<{ [K in keyof T]: Awaited<T[K]> }>} A promise that resolves to an object with the same keys and resolved values.
 *
 * @example
 * const { user, posts } = await allKeyed({
 *   user: fetchUser(),
 *   posts: fetchPosts(),
 * });
 *
 * @example
 * // Plain values are also supported
 * const result = await allKeyed({
 *   a: Promise.resolve(1),
 *   b: 2,
 * });
 * // { a: 1, b: 2 }

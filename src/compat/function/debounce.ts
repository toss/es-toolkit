/**
 * Creates a debounced function that delays invoking the provided function until after `debounceMs` milliseconds
 * have elapsed since the last time the debounced function was invoked. The debounced function also has a `cancel`
 * method to cancel any pending execution.
 *
 * You can set the debounced function to run at the start (`leading`) or end (`trailing`) of the delay period.
 * If `leading` is true, the function runs immediately on the first call.
 * If `trailing` is true, the function runs after `debounceMs` milliseconds have passed since the last call.
 * If both `leading` and `trailing` are true, the function runs at both the start and end, but it must be called at least twice within `debounceMs` milliseconds for this to happen
 * (since one debounced function call cannot trigger the function twice).
 *
 * You can also set a `maxWait` time, which is the maximum time the function is allowed to be delayed before it is called.
 *
 * @template F - The type of function.
 * @param {F} func - The function to debounce.
 * @param {number} debounceMs - The number of milliseconds to delay.
 * @param {DebounceOptions} options - The options object
 * @param {AbortSignal} options.signal - An optional AbortSignal to cancel the debounced function.
 * @param {boolean} options.leading - If `true`, the function will be invoked on the leading edge of the timeout.
 * @param {boolean} options.trailing - If `true`, the function will be invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout.
 * @param {number} options.maxWait - The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.

 * // Will not log anything as the previous call is canceled

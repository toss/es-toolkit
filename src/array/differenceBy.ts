/**
 * Computes the difference between two arrays after mapping their elements through a provided function.
 *
 * This function takes two arrays and a mapper function. It returns a new array containing the elements
 * that are present in the first array but not in the second array, based on the identity calculated
 * by the mapper function.
 *
 * Essentially, it filters out any elements from the first array that, when
 * mapped, match an element in the mapped version of the second array.
 *
 * @template T, U
 * @param {T[]} firstArr - The primary array from which to derive the difference.
 * @param {T[]} secondArr - The array containing elements to be excluded from the first array.
 * @param {(value: T) => U} mapper - The function to map the elements of both arrays. This function
 * is applied to each element in both arrays, and the comparison is made based on the mapped values.
 * @returns {T[]} A new array containing the elements from the first array that do not have a corresponding
 * mapped identity in the second array.
 *
 * @example
 * const array1 = [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }];
 * const array2 = [{ id: 2 }, { id: 4 }];
 * const mapper = item => item.id;
 * const result = differenceBy(array1, array2, mapper);
 * // result will be [{ id: 1 }, { id: 3 }] since the elements with id 2 are in both arrays and are excluded from the result.
